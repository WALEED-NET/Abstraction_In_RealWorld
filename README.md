## Abstraction

**What is Abstraction?**

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object.

**When to use Abstraction?**

- When you want to provide a common interface for a group of related classes.
- When you want to hide the complex implementation details and only show the necessary features of the object.
- When you want to define a contract for the derived classes and require them to implement the contract.

**Scenarios Where Abstraction is Useful:**

1. **Frameworks and Libraries**
2. **User Interfaces**
3. **Database Access**
4. **Dependency Injection**
5. **System Architecture**

**How to Implement Abstraction in C#?**

1. **Abstract Classes**
2. **Interfaces**
